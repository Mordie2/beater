# beater

A small two-deck, loop-based DJ app that sits next to Resolume. Qt 6 / QML / C++, macOS first.

## Build

Open `CMakeLists.txt` in Qt Creator with the Qt 6.11 macOS kit and hit Run. Or from a terminal:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=~/Qt/6.11.2/macos
cmake --build build
open build/beater.app
```

The first configure clones miniaudio and Rubber Band from GitHub (FetchContent), so it needs internet once.

If `cmake` / `ninja` aren't on your PATH, use the ones Qt ships:
`export PATH=~/Qt/Tools/CMake/CMake.app/Contents/bin:~/Qt/Tools/Ninja:$PATH`.

Headless engine checks: `./build/engine_test`.

Files or folders passed on the command line are added to the playlist. Debug hooks
(environment variables, see `src/main.cpp`): `BEATER_TEST=1` uses Qt's test data
folders instead of the real library, `BEATER_AUTOPLAY=1` loads rows 1 and 2 into
decks A and B, plays them and logs deck state, and `BEATER_SNAPSHOT=out.png` saves
a grab of the window after a few seconds and quits.

## How it works

- **Master tempo** is a fixed BPM you set (drag the number, scroll, ±, or double-click to type). Everything follows it.
- **Sync** is on by default for each deck. A synced deck is time-stretched to the master tempo and phase-locked to the master grid (Rubber Band R3 engine, so pitch is untouched). Pressing play starts the deck immediately, already in phase: it jumps to the nearest position whose beat (or bar, with PHASE = BAR) matches the master.
- **Key shift** in semitones, tempo stays locked. The key readout follows.
- **Loops**: every track has a loop region. By default it is the last N bars (END), so a track that runs out keeps looping its ending until you bring the next one in. Drag across the overview waveform to set your own region (snaps to bars, hold Option to snap to beats), or use HERE to loop N bars from the current bar. LOOP toggles looping on the deck.
- **Volume**: a fader per deck plus master. No automatic transitions.
- **Analysis**: BPM and beat grid are detected on import. Everything is editable: double-click the BPM to type it, ×2 / ÷2, TAP, nudge the grid, SET 1 puts the downbeat at the playhead. Edits are stored per track (keyed by file content, so renames don't lose them) in `~/Library/Application Support/BLOCK SYSTEM/beater/library.json` and are never overwritten by re-analysis.

## Layout

```
src/core       small shared types (beat grid, keys, lock-free queue, track buffer)
src/audio      decoder (ExtAudioFile on macOS, miniaudio fallback), deck engine, audio engine
src/analysis   tempo / grid estimator
src/app        Qt side: library model, deck + app controllers, waveform item
qml/           UI
tests/         headless engine tests
```

Audio thread rules: no locks, no allocation. The UI talks to it through a lock-free command queue and atomics; decoded buffers are released back to the UI thread for freeing.
